# Travel-Delay-Across-Airports-Carriers
In this project, we creat and analyze dimensional, relational, and analytical data models based on airline flight delay status and financial data for data engineering purposes.

**(More details in the Model.sql and proposal pdf file.)**

## Database Source: 
● Airline_Delay_Cause.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadkhattak/us-flight-delay- from-january-2017-july-2022)
● T_F41SCHEDULE_B1.csv (https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FKM&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4 %20Pn44vr4%20Sv0n0pvny)
● T_SCHEDULE_T3.csv (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FKG&QO_fu146_anzr= Nv4%20Pn44vr4%20f7zzn4B)
● T_T100_MARKET_ALL_CARRIER (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FMF&QO_fu146_anzr= Nv4%20Pn44vr45)
In addition to the Flight Delay from Jan 2017 to July 2022 dataset from Kaggle, we also collected data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that help us identify the carrier’s region, group, service class, and the airport type(whether it is domestic or international).

### Data for Modeling and Analysis:
(* We create four datasets for analysis, which can be seen in folder 'Data for Analysis')

### How we get these four datasets (10 tables in model):
1. Table 1: delay.

		id (PK)
		year
		month
		carrier_id (FK)
		airport_id (FK)
		arr_flights: Number of flights arriving at airport
		arr_del15: Number of flights more than 15 minutes late
		carrier_ct: Number of flights delayed due to air carrier. (e.g. no crew)
		weather_ct: Number of flights due to weather.
		nas_ct: Number of flights delayed due to National Aviation System (e.g. heavy air traffic).
		arr_delay:Total time (minutes) of delayed flight.
		carrier_delay: Total time (minutes) of delay due to air carrier
		weather_delay: Total time (minutes) of delay due to inclement weather.
		nas_delay: Total time (minutes) of delay due to National Aviation System.
		security_delay: Total time (minutes) of delay as a result of a security issue.
		lateaircraftdelay: Total time (minutes) of delay flights as a result of a previous flight on the same airplane being late.
		security_ct: Number of flights canceled due to a security breach.
		lateaircraftct;Number of flights delayed as a result of another flight on the same aircraft delayed
		arr_cancelled: Number of cancelled flights
		arr_diverted: Number of flights that were diverted
